    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>It has been in process for a little while, starting when I moved the bulk of my DNS hosting from <a href="http://www.bytemark.co.uk/">http://www.bytemark.co.uk/</a> (with whom I've had a small virtual machine since April 2004). One of the things I really like about Bytemark was the free DNS hosting they provided, particularly since they used <a href="http://tinydns.org/">TinyDNS</a> - which is worthy of its own post. To add a new domain name, create a small file with the relevant lines, with one per DNS record - really easy if you have any kind of database or automation.</p>

<!-- tinydns record --></p>

<p>Back in April (2012), I came across <a href="http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=3794654">a post on HackerNews</a> to <a href="http://www.luadns.com/">http://www.luadns.com/</a>. This is a system that again, uses TinyDNS as a backend, but instead of some hacked-together PHP scripts I wrote to produce the data files, they are run through a Lua script. That gives the benefit of very easy to read configurations, and then the files themselves are stored in a Git repository, which can arrange to notify the main luadns website whenever it is changed, so the records are updated whenever the repository is.</p>

<p><div><script src='https://gist.github.com/4419224.js'></script>
<noscript><pre><code>-- File: abulman.co.uk.lua
-- Zone: abulman.co.uk
-- SOA record is automatically generated
-- Variable _a is replaced with zone name
-- _a = &quot;abulman.co.uk&quot; (from the filename)

-- _webserverIP &amp; _longTTL are variables

-- A records - 
std_a(_a, _webserverIP)
a('blog', _webserverIP, _longTTL)

-- CNAME records
cname(&quot;pages&quot;, 'ghs.google.com')
-- Templates (see templates.lua)
google_app(_a, 'ghs.google.com', _longTTL)
</code></pre></noscript></div>
<!-- luadns record --></p>

<p>So, with the use of the service from luadns, I had a good reason to a) move my DNS off bytemark (with the intention to also eventually shut down my old server there), and b) tidy it up as I went. So I did. I had already moved my tech-blog to <a href="http://phpscaling.com/">http://phpscaling.com/</a> last year, and over this last few weeks, I added <a href="http://abulman.co.uk/">http://abulman.co.uk/</a> to the same Wordpress installation.</p>

<p>Supporting different domain names for (at least) two different blogs isn't too easy in a stack Wordpress 3 installation. It isn't made any easier becuase I also have a couple of domain name aliases that point to the <a href="http://abulman.co.uk/">http://abulman.co.uk/</a> site (there is also <a href="http://alisterb.co.uk/">http://alisterb.co.uk/</a>, and of course there is also the www.* versions) and so I was having a lot of trouble till I found the <a href="http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/wordpress-mu-domain-mapping/">wordpress-mu-domain-mapping</a> plugin. While it's not quite a drop-in plugin (you have to copy some files around manually) and of course setup the IP address and domain names, it solved my problem.</p>
