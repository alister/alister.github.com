Welcome. I've taken some time over the holidays to do a little re-organisation of my online presence, and I'd like to tell you what I did, and how.

First up, is this site. I've been considering what to put onto my Github pages for a while, and I think the most obvious thing are links to my recent work. As it is build on [Octopress/Jekyll](http://octopress.org/),  it is also well supported by Github, and allows me to add static content pages into the site as well, so I've moved my online presentations here, from <http://abulman.co.uk>

### My presentations

I've done a couple now, both on Queueing systems, and particularly on BeanstalkD, which is a very excellent system for such job-queues.

* [Beanstalkd](/presentations/Beanstalkd/) PHP London, May 6th 2010
* [Queuing, the good and bad](/presentations/QueueGoodBad/) London Scalability Group, 16th July 2012

You should also check out my other post, which I also wrote today, [DNS and my refreshed CV site](/blog/2012/12/31/dns-and-my-refreshed-cv-site/)
