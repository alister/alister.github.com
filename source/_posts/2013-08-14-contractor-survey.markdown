I'm in the planning stages of a new website - a service for contractors and those that want to find us. While finding the recruiters is easy enough (they just keep calling me), I'm also interested in finding out what are some of the challenges that other contractors find with getting new jobs - beyond my own itch.

If you are a Contractor - in IT & web development, or otherwise, I would very much appreciate finding out how you go about getting new contracts, and when I get a useful number of replies, I'll post a summary of the results here.
